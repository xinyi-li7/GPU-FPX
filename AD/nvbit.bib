abstract = {Deep learning(DL) techniques attract people from various fields with superior performance in making progressive breakthroughs. To ensure the quality of DL techniques, researchers have been working on testing and verification approaches. Some recent studies reveal that the underlying DL operators could cause defects inside a DL model. DL operators work as fundamental components in DL libraries. Library developers still work on practical approaches to ensure the quality of operators they provide. However, the variety of DL operators and the implementation complexity make it challenging to evaluate their quality. Operator testing with limited test cases may fail to reveal hidden defects inside the implementation. Besides, the existing model-to-library testing approach requires extra labor and time cost to identify and locate errors, i.e., developers can only react to the exposed defects. This paper proposes a fuzzing-based operator-level precision testing approach to estimate individual DL operators’ precision errors to bridge this gap. Unlike conventional fuzzing techniques, valid shape variable inputs and fine-grained precision error evaluation are implemented. The testing of DL operators is treated as a searching problem to maximize output precision errors. We implement our approach in a tool named Predoo and conduct an experiment on seven DL operators from TensorFlow. The experiment result shows that Predoo can trigger larger precision errors compared to the error threshold declared in the testing scripts from the TensorFlow repository.},

abstract = {Approximate computing, the technique that sacrifices certain amount of accuracy in exchange for substantial performance boost or power reduction, is one of the most promising solutions to enable power control and performance scaling towards exascale. Although most existing approximation designs target the emerging data-intensive applications that are comparatively more error-tolerable, there is still high demand for the acceleration of traditional scientific applications (e.g., weather and nuclear simulation), which often comprise intensive transcendental function calls and are very sensitive to accuracy loss. To address this challenge, we focus on a very important but long ignored approximation unit on today's commercial GPUs --- the special-function unit (SFU), and clarify its unique role in performance acceleration of accuracy-sensitive applications in the context of approximate computing. To better understand its features, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis on three generations of NVIDIA GPU architectures to evaluate all the single-precision and double-precision numeric transcendental functions that can be accelerated by SFUs, in terms of their performance, accuracy and power consumption. Based on the insights from the evaluation, we propose a transparent, tractable and portable design framework for SFU-driven approximate acceleration on GPUs. Our design is software-based and requires no hardware or application modifications. Experimental results on three NVIDIA GPU platforms demonstrate that our proposed framework can provide fine-grained tuning for performance and accuracy trade-offs, thus facilitating applications to achieve the maximum performance under certain accuracy constraints.},

We then also recognize that it is simple to generate these regions in such a way that they are idempotent, allowing their entry points to function as program recovery points and enabling support for exception handling, fast context switches, and speculation, all with very low overhead. We call the architecture of GPUs executing these idempotent regions the iGPU architecture. The hardware extensions required are minimal and the construction of idempotent code regions is fully transparent under the typical dynamic compilation framework of GPUs. We demonstrate how iGPU exception support enables virtual memory paging with very low overhead (1% to 4%), and how speculation support enables circuit-speculation techniques that can provide over 25% reduction in energy.},

abstract = {Floating-point arithmetic is widely used in applications from several fields including scientific computing, machine learning, graphics, and finance. Many of these applications are rapidly adopting the use of GPUs to speedup computations. GPUs, however, have limited support to detect floating-point exceptions, which hinders the development of reliable applications in GPU-based systems. We present FPChecker, the first tool to automatically detect floating-point exceptions in GPU applications. FPChecker uses the clang/LLVM compiler to instrument GPU kernels and to detect exceptions at runtime. Once an exception is detected, it reports to the programmer the code location of the exception as well as other useful information. The programmer can then use this report to avoid the exception, e.g., by modifying the application algorithm or changing the input. We present the design of FPChecker, an evaluation of the overhead of the tool, and a real-world case scenario on which the tool is used to identify a hidden exception. The slowdown of FPChecker is moderate and the code is publicly available as open source.},

abstract = {There are a number of schemes for handling arithmetic exceptions that can be used to improve the speed (or alternatively the reliability) of numeric code. Overflow and underflow are the most troublesome exceptions, and depending on the context in which the exception can occur, they may be addressed either: (1) through a “brute force” reevaluation with extended range, (2) by reevaluating using a technique known as scaling, (3) by substituting an infinity or zero, or (4) in the case of underflow, with gradual underflow. In the first two of these cases, the offending computation is simply reevaluated using a safer but slower method. The latter two cases are cheaper, more automated schemes that ideally are built in as options within the computer system. Other arithmetic exceptions can be handled with similar methods. These and some other techniques are examined with an eye toward determining the support programming languages and computer systems ought to provide for floating-point exception handling. It is argued that the cheapest short-term solution would be to give full support to most of the required (as opposed to recommended) special features of the IEC/IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic. An essential part of this support would include standardized access from high-level languages to the exception flags defined by the standard. Some possibilities outside the IEEE Standard are also considered, and a few thought on possible better-structured support within programming languages are discussed.},

abstract = {Volume image registration remains one of the best candidates for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) acceleration because of its enormous computation time and plentiful data-level parallelism. However, an efficient GPU implementation for image registration is still challenging due to the heavy utilization of expensive atomic operations for similarity calculations. In this paper, we first propose five GPU-friendly Correlation Ratio (CR) based methods to accelerate the process of image registration. Compared to widely used Mutual Information (MI) based methods, the CR-based approaches require less resource for shadow histograms, a faster storage, such as the on-chip scratchpad memory, therefore can be fully exploited to achieve better performance. Second, we make design space exploration of the CR-based methods, and study the trade-off of introducing shadow histograms on different storage (shared memory, global memory) by computation units of different granularity (thread, warp, thread block). Third, we exhaustively test the proposed designs on GPUs of different generations (Fermi, Kepler and Maxwell) so that performance variations due to hardware migration are addressed. Finally, we evaluate the performance impact corresponding to the tuning of concurrency, algorithm settings as well as overheads incurred by preprocessing, smoothing and workload unbalancing. We highlight our last CR approach which completely avoids updating conflicts of histogram calculation, leading to substantial performance improvements (up to 55× speedup over naive CPU implementation). It reduces the registration time from 145s to 2.6s for two typical 256×256×160 volume images on a Kepler GPU.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach for debugging errors in floating point computation by performing shadow execution with higher precision in parallel. The programmer specifies parts of the program that need to be debugged for errors. Our compiler creates shadow execution tasks, which execute on different cores and perform the computation with higher precision. We propose a novel method to execute a shadow execution task from an arbitrary memory state, which is necessary because we are creating a parallel shadow execution from a sequential program. Our approach also ensures that the shadow execution follows the same control flow path as the original program. Our runtime automatically distributes the shadow execution tasks to balance the load on the cores. Our prototype for parallel shadow execution, PFPSanitizer, provides comprehensive detection of errors while having lower performance overheads than prior approaches.},

abstract = {Automated techniques for rigorous floating-point round-off error analysis are a prerequisite to placing important activities in HPC such as precision allocation, verification, and code optimization on a formal footing. Yet existing techniques cannot provide tight bounds for expressions beyond a few dozen operators---barely enough for HPC. In this work, we offer an approach embedded in a new tool called Satire that scales error analysis by four orders of magnitude compared to today's best-of-class tools. We explain how three key ideas underlying Satire helps it attain such scale: path strength reduction, bound optimization, and abstraction. Satire provides tight bounds and rigorous guarantees on significantly larger expressions with well over a hundred thousand operators, covering important examples including FFT, matrix multiplication, and PDE stencils.},

abstract="Rigorous estimation of bounds on errors in finite precision computation has become a key point of many formal verification tools. The primary interest of the use of such tools is generally to obtain worst-case bounds on the absolute errors. However, the natural bound on the elementary error committed by each floating-point arithmetic operation is a bound on the relative error, which suggests that relative error bounds could also play a role in the process of computing tight error estimations. In this work, we introduce a very simple interval-based abstraction, combining absolute and relative error propagations. We demonstrate with a prototype implementation how this simple product allows us in many cases to improve absolute error bounds, and even to often favorably compare with state-of-the art tools, that rely on much more costly relational abstractions or optimization-based estimations.",

abstract="The precise semantics of floating-point arithmetic programs depends on the execution platform, including the compiler and the target hardware. Platform dependencies are particularly pronounced for arithmetic-intensive parallel numeric programs and infringe on the highly desirable goal of software portability (which is nonetheless promised by heterogeneous computing frameworks like OpenCL): the same program run on the same inputs on different platforms often produces different results. Serious doubts on the portability of numeric applications arise when these differences are behavioral, i.e. when they lead to changes in the control flow of a program. In this paper we present an algorithm that takes a numeric procedure and determines an input that may lead to different branching decisions depending on how the arithmetic in the procedure is compiled. We illustrate the algorithm on a diverse set of examples, characteristic of scientific numeric computing, where control flow divergence actually occurs across different execution platforms.",
